# Set up local tags: git clone will not preserve these
#    See the convertTags script for guidance how, though you may want to hack
#    it.  In particular, you might want to replace ancient CVS tagging
#    conventions (tor-0_1_0-alpha) with nice new ones (v0.1.0-alpha).
#
#    The script signs its tags.  If you don't want that, edit it to pass
#    -s instead of -a.
#
#    If you wind up signing the tag, you may wind having to copy the whole
#    tree over to some machine where the key you want lives, unless you
#    are okay with having your private key live on moria.
